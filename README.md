#ece548: intro to machine learning

Project 1 involved implementing perceptron learning and investigating
linear vs. polynomial classifiers. See `project1/info/task.txt` or
`project1/info/batch2.pdf`. For the PDF, we were group 5.

Project 2 involved experimenting with imbalanced class representations;
techniques used included majority-class undersampling and one-sided Tomek link
selection. See `project2/info/batch2.pdf` for more details; we were group 10.

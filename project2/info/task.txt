Group 10
Design an experiment that illustrates the problem with imbalanced class repre-
sentation (See Section 10.2 in the textbook). To address this problem, use the
majority-class underampling mechanism based on one-sided selection. For per-
formance evaluation, use precision and recall discussed in Section 11.2.
